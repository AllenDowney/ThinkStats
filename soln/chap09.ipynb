    "## Classical hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the data from the NSFG, we saw several \"apparent effects,\"\n",
    "including differences between first babies and others. So far we have\n",
    "taken these effects at face value; in this chapter, we put them to the\n",
    "test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental question we want to address is whether the effects we\n",
    "see in a sample are likely to appear in the larger population. For\n",
    "example, in the NSFG sample we see a difference in mean pregnancy length\n",
    "for first babies and others. We would like to know if that effect\n",
    "reflects a real difference for women in the U.S., or if it might appear\n",
    "in the sample by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways we could formulate this question, including\n",
    "Fisher null hypothesis testing, Neyman-Pearson decision theory, and\n",
    "Bayesian inference[^1]. What I present here is a subset of all three\n",
    "that makes up most of what people use in practice, which I will call\n",
    "**classical hypothesis testing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of classical hypothesis testing is to answer the question,\n",
    "\"Given a sample and an apparent effect, what is the probability of\n",
    "seeing such an effect by chance?\" Here's how we answer that question:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The first step is to quantify the size of the apparent effect by\n",
    "    choosing a **test statistic**. In the NSFG example, the apparent\n",
    "    effect is a difference in pregnancy length between first babies and\n",
    "    others, so a natural choice for the test statistic is the difference\n",
    "    in means between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The second step is to define a **null hypothesis**, which is a model\n",
    "    of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect is\n",
    "    not real. In the NSFG example the null hypothesis is that there is\n",
    "    no difference between first babies and others; that is, that\n",
    "    pregnancy lengths for both groups have the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The third step is to compute a **p-value**, which is the probability\n",
    "    of seeing the apparent effect if the null hypothesis is true. In the\n",
    "    NSFG example, we would compute the actual difference in means, then\n",
    "    compute the probability of seeing a difference as big, or bigger,\n",
    "    under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The last step is to interpret the result. If the p-value is low, the\n",
    "    effect is said to be **statistically significant**, which means that\n",
    "    it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. In that case we infer\n",
    "    that the effect is more likely to appear in the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of this process is similar to a proof by contradiction. To\n",
    "prove a mathematical statement, A, you assume temporarily that A is\n",
    "false. If that assumption leads to a contradiction, you conclude that A\n",
    "must actually be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to test a hypothesis like, \"This effect is real,\" we assume,\n",
    "temporarily, that it is not. That's the null hypothesis. Based on that\n",
    "assumption, we compute the probability of the apparent effect. That's\n",
    "the p-value. If the p-value is low, we conclude that the null hypothesis\n",
    "is unlikely to be true.\n",

    "-   If the effect is actually due to chance, what is the probability\n",
    "    that we will wrongly consider it significant? This probability is\n",
    "    the **false positive rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If the effect is real, what is the chance that the hypothesis test\n",
    "    will fail? This probability is the **false negative rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The false positive rate is relatively easy to compute: if the threshold\n",
    "is 5%, the false positive rate is 5%. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If there is no real effect, the null hypothesis is true, so we can\n",
    "    compute the distribution of the test statistic by simulating the\n",
    "    null hypothesis. Call this distribution $\\CDF_T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each time we run an experiment, we get a test statistic, $t$, which\n",
    "    is drawn from $CDF_T$. Then we compute a p-value, which is the\n",
    "    probability that a random value from $CDF_T$ exceeds `t`, so that's\n",
    "    $1 - CDF_T(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The p-value is less than 5% if $CDF_T(t)$ is greater than 95%; that\n",

    "\n",
    "The hypothesis testing process I demonstrated in this chapter is not,\n",

    "First, I performed multiple tests. If you run one hypothesis test, the\n",

    "\n",

    "it is significant, you have a good chance of generating a false\n",
    "positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compensate for multiple tests, you can adjust the p-value threshold\n",
    "(see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm-Bonferroni_method>). Or you can\n",
    "address both problems by partitioning the data, using one set for\n",
    "exploration and the other for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some fields these practices are required or at least encouraged. But\n",
    "it is also common to address these problems implicitly by replicating\n",
    "published results. Typically the first paper to report a new result is\n",
    "considered exploratory. Subsequent papers that replicate the result with\n",
    "new data are considered confirmatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it happens, we have an opportunity to replicate the results in this\n",
    "chapter. The first edition of this book is based on Cycle 6 of the NSFG,\n",
    "which was released in 2002. In October 2011, the CDC released additional\n",
    "data based on interviews conducted from 2006--2010. `nsfg2.py` contains\n",
    "code to read and clean this data. In the new dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The difference in mean pregnancy length is 0.16 weeks and\n",
    "    statistically significant with $p < 0.001$ (compared to 0.078 weeks\n",
    "    in the original dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The difference in birth weight is 0.17 pounds with $p < 0.001$\n",
    "    (compared to 0.12 lbs in the original dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The correlation between birth weight and mother's age is 0.08 with\n",
    "    $p < 0.001$ (compared to 0.07).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The chi-squared test is statistically significant with $p < 0.001$\n",
    "    (as it was in the original).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, all of the effects that were statistically significant in\n",
