    "In several sports -- especially basketball -- many players and fans believe in a phenomenon called the \"hot hand\", which implies that a player who has hit several consecutive shots is more likely to hit the next, and a player who has missed several times is more likely to miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "A famous paper proposed a way to test whether the hot hand is real or a statistical illusion, by looking at sequences of hits and misses from professional basketball games.\n",
    "For each player, the authors computed the overall probability of making a shot, and the conditional probability of making a shot after three consecutive hits.\n",
    "For eight out of nine players, they found that the probability of making a shot was *lower* after three hits.\n",
    "Based on this and other results, they concluded that there is \"no evidence for a positive correlation between the outcomes of successive shots\".\n",
    "And for several decades, many people believed that the hot hand had been debunked.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this conclusion is based on a statistical error, at least in part.\n",
    "A 2018 paper showed that the statistic used in the first paper -- the probability of making a shot after three hits -- is biased.\n",
    "Even if the probability of making every shot is exactly 0.5, and there is no correlation between the outcomes, the probability of making a shot after three hits is *less than 0.5*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not obvious why that's true, which is why the error went undetected for so long, and I won't try to explain it here.\n",
    "But we can use the methods from this chapter to check it.\n",
