    "# Modeling Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The distributions we have used so far are called empirical distributions because they are based on empirical observations -- in other words, data. Many datasets we see in the real world can be closely approximated by a theoretical distribution, which is usually based on a simple mathematical model. This chapter presents some of these theoretical distributions and datasets they can be used to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As examples, we'll see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    In a skeet shooting competition, the number of hits and misses is well modeled by a binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    In games like hockey and soccer (football), the number of goals in a game follows a Poisson distribution, and the time between goals follows an exponential distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Birth weights follow a normal distribution, also called a Gaussian, and adult weights follow a lognormal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with these distributions -- or these sports -- I will explain what you need to know. For each example, we'll start with a simulation based on a simple model, and show that the simulation results follow an theoretical distribution. Then we'll see how well real data agrees with the model."
