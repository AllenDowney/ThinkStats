    "-   They are easier to explain and understand. For example, one of the most difficult topics in an introductory statistics class is hypothesis testing. Many students don't really understand what p-values are. I think the approach we took in Chapter¬†xxx -- simulating the null hypothesis and computing test statistics -- makes the fundamental idea clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   They are robust and versatile. Analytic methods are often based on assumptions that don't hold in practice. Computational methods require fewer assumptions, and can be adapted and extended more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   They are debuggable. Analytic methods are often like a black box: you plug in numbers and they spit out results. But it's easy to make subtle errors, hard to be confident that the results are right, and hard to find the problem if they are not. Computational methods lend themselves to incremental development and testing, which fosters confidence in the results."
