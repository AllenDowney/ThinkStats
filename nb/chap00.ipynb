    "\n",
    "This book is an introduction to the practical tools of exploratory data\n",
    "analysis. The organization of the book follows the process I use when I\n",
    "start working with a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Importing and cleaning: Whatever format the data is in, it usually\n",
    "    takes some time and effort to read the data, clean and transform it,\n",
    "    and check that everything made it through the translation process\n",
    "    intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Single variable explorations: I usually start by examining one\n",
    "    variable at a time, finding out what the variables mean, looking at\n",
    "    distributions of the values, and choosing appropriate summary\n",
    "    statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Pair-wise explorations: To identify possible relationships between\n",
    "    variables, I look at tables and scatter plots, and compute\n",
    "    correlations and linear fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Multivariate analysis: If there are apparent relationships between\n",
    "    variables, I use multiple regression to add control variables and\n",
    "    investigate more complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Estimation and hypothesis testing: When reporting statistical\n",
    "    results, it is important to answer three questions: How big is the\n",
    "    effect? How much variability should we expect if we run the same\n",
    "    measurement again? Is it possible that the apparent effect is due to\n",
    "    chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Visualization: During exploration, visualization is an important\n",
    "    tool for finding possible relationships and effects. Then if an\n",
    "    apparent effect holds up to scrutiny, visualization is an effective\n",
    "    way to communicate results."

    "This book takes a computational approach, which has several advantages\n",
    "over mathematical approaches:\n",

    "-   I present most ideas using Python code, rather than mathematical\n",
    "    notation. In general, Python code is more readable; also, because it\n",
    "    is executable, readers can download it, run it, and modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each chapter includes exercises readers can do to develop and\n",
    "    solidify their learning. When you write programs, you express your\n",
    "    understanding in code; while you are debugging the program, you are\n",
    "    also correcting your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Some exercises involve experiments to test statistical behavior. For\n",
    "    example, you can explore the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by\n",
    "    generating random samples and computing their sums. The resulting\n",
    "    visualizations demonstrate why the CLT works and when it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Some ideas that are hard to grasp mathematically are easy to\n",
    "    understand by simulation. For example, we approximate p-values by\n",

    "## How I wrote this book\n",
    "\n",

    "of old textbooks. As a result, most books contain the same material in\n",
    "pretty much the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not do that. In fact, I used almost no printed material while I\n",
    "was writing this book, for several reasons:\n",

    "-   My goal was to explore a new approach to this material, so I didn't\n",
    "    want much exposure to existing approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Since I am making this book available under a free license, I wanted\n",
    "    to make sure that no part of it was encumbered by copyright\n",
    "    restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Many readers of my books don't have access to libraries of printed\n",
    "    material, so I tried to make references to resources that are freely\n",
    "    available on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Some proponents of old media think that the exclusive use of\n",
    "    electronic resources is lazy and unreliable. They might be right\n",
    "    about the first part, but I think they are wrong about the second,\n",
    "    so I wanted to test my theory."
