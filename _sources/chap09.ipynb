    "The goal of classical hypothesis testing is to answer the question,\n",
    "\"Given a sample and an apparent effect, what is the probability of\n",
    "seeing such an effect by chance?\" Here's how we answer that question:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The first step is to quantify the size of the apparent effect by\n",
    "    choosing a **test statistic**. In the NSFG example, the apparent\n",
    "    effect is a difference in pregnancy length between first babies and\n",
    "    others, so a natural choice for the test statistic is the difference\n",
    "    in means between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The second step is to define a **null hypothesis**, which is a model\n",
    "    of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect is\n",
    "    not real. In the NSFG example the null hypothesis is that there is\n",
    "    no difference between first babies and others; that is, that\n",
    "    pregnancy lengths for both groups have the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The third step is to compute a **p-value**, which is the probability\n",
    "    of seeing the apparent effect if the null hypothesis is true. In the\n",
    "    NSFG example, we would compute the actual difference in means, then\n",
    "    compute the probability of seeing a difference as big, or bigger,\n",
    "    under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The last step is to interpret the result. If the p-value is low, the\n",
    "    effect is said to be **statistically significant**, which means that\n",
    "    it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. In that case we infer\n",
    "    that the effect is more likely to appear in the larger population."
