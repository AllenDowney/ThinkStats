    "From the earliest history of statistics, there have been two ideas about what statistics is. In one view, it is a branch of mathematics with the goal of establishing a theoretical foundation for probability and statistical inference.\n",
    "In another view, it is a set of tools and practices for working with data, answering questions, and making better decisions.\n",
    "Many introductory classes in statistics are based on the first view.\n",

    "*Think Stats* is an introduction to practical methods for exploring and visualizing data, discovering relationships and trends, and communicating results. \n",
    "The organization of the book follows the process I use when I start working with a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importing and cleaning: Whatever format the data is in, it usually takes some time and effort to read the data, clean and transform it, and check that everything made it through the translation process intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single variable explorations: I usually start by examining one variable at a time, finding out what the variables mean, looking at distributions of the values, and choosing appropriate summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pair-wise explorations: To identify possible relationships between variables, I look at tables and scatter plots, and compute correlations and linear fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multivariate analysis: If there are apparent relationships between variables, I use multiple regression to add control variables and investigate more complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimation and hypothesis testing: When reporting statistical results, it is important to answer three questions: How big is the effect? How much variability should we expect if we run the same measurement again? Is it possible that the apparent effect is due to chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization: During exploration, visualization is an important tool for finding possible relationships and effects. Then if an apparent effect holds up to scrutiny, visualization is an effective way to communicate results."

    "This book takes a computational approach, which has several advantages over mathematical approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  I present most ideas using Python code, rather than mathematical notation. In general, Python code is more readable -- also, because it is executable, run it and modify it to develop deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Each chapter includes exercises readers can do to develop and solidify their learning. When you write programs, you express your understanding in code -- while you are debugging the program, you are also checking your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Some exercises involve experiments to test statistical behavior. For example, you can explore the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by generating random samples and computing their sums. The resulting visualizations demonstrate why the CLT works and when it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Some ideas that are hard to grasp mathematically are easy to understand by simulation. For example, we approximate p-values by running random simulations, which reinforces the meaning of hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Because the book is based on a general-purpose programming language (Python), readers can import data from almost any source. They are not limited to datasets that have been cleaned and formatted for a particular statistics tool."

    "After you clone the repository or unzip the zip file, you should have a folder called `ThinkStats2/code` with a file called nsfg.py.\n",
    "If you run nsfg.py, it should read a data file, run some tests, and print a message like, \"All tests passed.\" If you get import errors, it probably means there are packages you need to install."
